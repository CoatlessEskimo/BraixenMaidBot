For this bot to work correctly, you need to create a file in the same directory, called ".env", and it must contain the following text:

# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=yourdiscordtokengoeshere

If you want to avoid a headache while I finish up the file checks, go ahead and make sure to make the following files:
nsfwfilter-disabled.txt
ytfilter-disabled.txt
nsfwlinks.txt (fill this with your list of banned nsfw links)

Make sure to also include LICENSE.TXT, as it later will be a copy of the Affero GPL v3, and also include README.MD, with any modifications you like.
