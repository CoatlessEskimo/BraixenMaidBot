For this bot to work correctly, you need to create a file in the same directory, called ".env", and it must contain the following text:

```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=yourdiscordtokengoeshere
```

If you want to avoid a headache while I finish up the file checks, go ahead and make sure to make the following files exist and are rw:
nsfwfilter-disabled.txt
ytfilter-disabled.txt
nsfwlinks.txt (fill this with your list of banned nsfw links)

Make sure to also include the attached GNU Affero General Public License v3, and also include README.md, with any modifications you like.
